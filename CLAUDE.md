# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Part of the Ink and Agency ecosystem:** See **[INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md)** for how skills work with agents.

## Nature of this repo

This is a **Claude Skills Pack** — a collection of prompt-based skill definitions. Each skill is a markdown file (`SKILL.md`) in its own folder. There is no build system, test runner, or linter.

## Structure

```text
{skill-name}/SKILL.md          # Skill entry point (YAML frontmatter + instructions)
{skill-name}/*.md              # Supporting docs, formats, or deep-dive modules
clarity-council/               # Monorepo for the clarity-council skill suite
clarity-council/skills/        # Nested sub-skills (persona_consult, council_consult, etc.)
clarity-council/skills/personas/  # Persona contracts
```

## Skill format

Each `SKILL.md` begins with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
name: skill-name
description: >
  When to trigger this skill. Use "when user says X" or "Use when Y."
  Keep to 1-2 sentences.
version: 2.5.1                         # optional
license: MIT                           # optional
compatibility: claude-code opencode    # optional
allowed-tools:                         # optional
  - Read
  - Write
related-agents:                        # optional — agents that can use this skill
  - agent-name
  - another-agent
related-skills:                        # optional — other skills this skill uses
  - skill-a
  - skill-b
loop-eligible: true                    # optional — true if can run via /loop
recurrence-hint: daily                 # optional — daily/weekly/on-demand (if loop-eligible=true)
```

**Note:** The `related-agents` and `related-skills` fields should only include items that actually exist and have clear workflow connections to this skill. See **[INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md)** for guidance.

## Extended Skill Format: Loop Method

The Loop Method adds optional frontmatter fields and markdown sections to enable:
1. **Cross-skill delegation:** Declare which other skills this skill uses
2. **Quality loops:** Self-evaluate output before returning
3. **Recurring execution:** Document how this skill runs via `/loop`

### New Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Rules | Example |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| `related-skills` | Array[string] | 0-6 skill names; must exist | `related-skills: [grill-me, clarity-council]` |
| `loop-eligible` | Boolean | True if can run recurring; false otherwise | `loop-eligible: true` |
| `recurrence-hint` | Enum | `daily`, `weekly`, `on-demand`, `none`; required if loop-eligible=true | `recurrence-hint: daily` |

### Quality Loop Section

Add an optional "Quality Loop" section to your SKILL.md (after main instructions):

```markdown
## Quality Loop

This skill evaluates its output before returning it.

1. **Generate initial output** — Follow main workflow
2. **Self-evaluate** — Against criteria:
   - Completeness: All required fields present?
   - Accuracy: Facts grounded in input?
   - Actionability: Can user take next step?
   - Format: Matches template?
3. **Loop condition** — If ≥2 criteria fail, refine and re-evaluate
4. **Exit** — When all pass OR max 2 iterations reached
```

### Delegation Map Section

Add an optional "Delegation Map" section to your SKILL.md (at end of file):

```markdown
## Delegation Map

| User Need | Delegate Via | Parameters |
|-----------|---|---|
| [Use case] | Invoke `[skill]` with ... | [params] |
| [Use case] | Agent `[agent]` for... | [context] |

**Loop eligibility:** [true/false]  
**Recurrence:** [daily/weekly/on-demand]  
**Example:** `/loop 1d /[skill-name] --param value`
```

### Examples

#### good-morning (Orchestration Skill)

```yaml
---
name: good-morning
related-skills: [sprint-snapshot, daily-standup-prep, daily-briefing]
related-agents: [scrum-master, project-manager]
loop-eligible: false  # Orchestrator doesn't recur alone; components do
---
```

#### sprint-snapshot (Repeating Skill)

```yaml
---
name: sprint-snapshot
related-skills: [sprint-plan, sprint-review, daily-standup-prep]
related-agents: [scrum-master, project-manager]
loop-eligible: true
recurrence-hint: weekly  # Usually run once per sprint, or on-demand
---
```

### Validation Rules

- **Existence check:** related-skills and related-agents must be real
- **No self-reference**
- **No circular chains:** A→B→C→A rejected
- **Type correctness:** Skill names only in related-skills; agent names only in related-agents
- **Recurrence consistency:** loop-eligible=true requires recurrence-hint

Validation is performed by the agents linting script when the ecosystem is synchronized.

## Skills inventory

> **Public skills only.** Private skills live in `_private/` and surface as junctions in the root (e.g. `cpf`, `mr-*`, `setup-*`). They are gitignored and **must not** be listed here. To check what's private: `cmd //c "dir /AL"` lists junctions, and `.gitignore` is the canonical list.

| Skill | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| branch-rebase | Safely rebase the current branch onto its upstream target; auto-resolves trivial conflicts |
| branch-resolve-conflicts | Resolve complex merge/rebase conflicts by reconstructing intent, preserving both branches' goals when possible, running full automated checks (typecheck, tests, format) |
| break-it-down | Decode messages into plain language with tone/intent analysis |
| clarity-council | Persona-based consultation (single/multi-persona, iterative) |
| codebase-churn | Git-history treemap (SVG): area = lines changed, color = commit frequency — find unstable, bug-prone files |
| codebase-explain | High-level context and module mapping for unfamiliar code areas |
| codebase-improve-architecture | Find refactor/deepening opportunities, informed by CONTEXT.md and ADRs |
| daily-briefing | Outlook-driven daily briefing: 24h email + calendar recap, today's schedule, action items, focus blocks |
| daily-standup-prep | Per-team standup report: gathers Jira/GitLab/Confluence/Git activity over N days, maps to roster, renders Mermaid kanban + talking order, writes to vault |
| defuddle | Extract clean markdown from web pages via Defuddle CLI (use instead of WebFetch for HTML) |
| energy-budget | Spoon-theory accounting for the calendar: score today's load, flag burnout risk, suggest defers. Council: personal-assistant + psychologist |
| good-morning | Morning kickoff wrapper: runs sprint-snapshot (daily tag) → daily-standup-prep (with burndown) → daily-briefing (report only, no focus blocks). Idempotent — overwrites today's artifacts on re-run |
| grill-me | Stress-test plans through iterative questioning |
| grill-with-docs | Grilling against domain docs + updating CONTEXT/ADR artifacts inline |
| handoff | Compact the current conversation into a structured handoff document so a fresh agent can pick up work without re-deriving context. Saves to OS temp directory, includes suggested skills, redacts sensitive data. |
| hyperfocus-recovery | Reconstruct context after a deep session or interruption from git/file artifacts → suggested re-entry point |
| idea-choice | Deliberate pros/cons analysis for one or more ideas: clarity-council pass + optional grill-me, scores each item on Impact × Confidence, renders markdown table per idea, comparison table across ideas, recommendation (Go / Go with caveats / Don't / Needs more analysis). Complements idea-generate (which produces ideas) and idea-decision-maker (which forces a fast binary pick) |
| idea-decision-maker | Force a pick between options to defeat analysis paralysis. Council: senior-architect + devils-advocate + personal-assistant vote, majority wins. Fast counterpart to idea-choice — use when the user needs a verdict, not a written record (was: `decision-breaker`) |
| idea-generate | Generate and refine ideas from loose topics using Divergence (council) and Convergence (grill) workflows |
| interest-capture | Fast capture for hyperfixations so they don't derail today's work but aren't lost. Files into Obsidian inbox, returns user to task |
| issue-dup-find | Scan open Jira issues (default project from memory) for likely duplicates → markdown report with probability + reason (read-only) |
| issue-estimate-sp | Story point estimation via Jira context + scrum-poker council session (read-only) |
| issue-feature-breakdown | Read-only Jira/Confluence context gathering + council analysis → actionable breakdown |
| issue-suggest-component | Suggest Jira components for a ticket or sweep a project (default project from memory, max 250). Confirms before each add; can create new components |
| issue-triage | Triage Jira ticket or free-form bug → ranked root-cause hypotheses + solution paths (read-only) |
| meeting-decompression | Process a meeting dump: separate facts/action-items/social ambiguities. Sorts ruminations into "worth following up on" vs "RSD noise". Council: psychologist + personal-assistant |
| obsidian-bases | Create and edit Obsidian Bases (.base files) — views, filters, formulas, summaries |
| obsidian-canvas | Create and edit Obsidian .canvas files (nodes, edges, groups, connections) |
| obsidian-charts | Build interactive Chart.js charts in Obsidian via `chart` codeblocks — inline literal series, link to a markdown table by `^blockId` (same note or cross-file), or render from a Dataview/Dataviewjs query via `window.renderChart` |
| obsidian-cli | Interact with Obsidian vaults via CLI: notes, tasks, properties; supports plugin/theme dev |
| obsidian-markdown | Create and edit Obsidian Flavored Markdown (wikilinks, callouts, frontmatter, embeds) |
| obsidian-vault | Search, create, and manage notes in the Obsidian vault with wikilinks and index notes |
| rejection-sensitivity-check | Calibrate a stung-by message: separate evidence from interpretation, score warranted sting 1–5. Council: psychologist + devils-advocate (always) |
| request-refactor-plan | Build incremental refactor plan via interview → file as GitHub issue |
| skill-create | Create new skills with structured prompts, resources, and packaging conventions |
| sprint-plan | Convert the start-of-sprint canvas into a planning markdown report (committed scope split carry-over vs new commit, capacity vs commitment, WIP-saturation risk, observations, risks). Assumes all unclosed items from the previous sprint's `end.canvas` carry into this one. Date-stamped output: same-day re-runs refresh silently, prior days preserved. Auto-runs clarity-council. Port of `Prompts/Sprint Plan.md`. |
| sprint-review | End-of-sprint stakeholder report: compares `start.canvas` to `end.canvas`, fits the standard SM template (Accomplishments / Status / Sprint Commitment / PI Confidence / Impediments). Auto-runs clarity-council. Port of `Prompts/Sprint Review.md`. |
| sprint-snapshot | Point-in-time snapshot of a scrum team's sprint board: writes Obsidian Canvas + companion markdown summary + append-only JSONL trend log into the team's vault folder. Auto-detects sprint phase; supports `--as-of` for historical snapshots. Port of `Sprint-Planner.ps1`. Hosts the shared `_team-rules.md` schema used by all `sprint-*` skills. |
| sprint-sos-report | Weekly scrum-of-scrums report comparing two sprint snapshots: scope changes, status transitions, per-member workload delta, wedge balancing, council findings/observations/trouble-areas/trends. Auto-detects which two snapshots to compare (`--from`/`--to` overrides for re-planning churn). Port of `Prompts/Scrum of Scrums.md`. |
| task-initiation | Defeat executive-function stalls with one ≤30-second physical action — not a plan, not a breakdown. Inline-only (no council, speed matters) |
| time-reality-check | Counter time blindness with a calibrated three-point estimate (best/likely/worst) accounting for setup, interruptions, re-entry. Council: statistics-expert + devils-advocate |
| writing-apology-calibrator | Calibrate a drafted apology: strip reflexive over-apology, keep warranted accountability. Council: psychologist + devils-advocate |
| writing-beats | Shape an article as a journey of beats, choose-your-own-adventure style |
| writing-cold-open | Produce just the first sentence of a message when the blank cursor is winning. Three openings (direct/warm/contextual), then steps out |
| writing-draft-article | Guide from raw idea/draft to a finished, polished article through iterative questioning |
| writing-fragments | Mine the user for raw writing fragments before imposing structure |
| writing-humanize | Remove signs of AI-generated writing from text |
| writing-shape | Shape raw material into an article paragraph by paragraph through a conversational session |
| writing-social-script | Generate a literal script for a dreaded social scenario. Three phrasings (direct/neutral/softened) + exit line. Council: psychologist + customer-advocate |
| writing-tone-check | Pre-send tone reviewer: paste a draft, get a landing prediction (cold / passive-aggressive / over-apologetic) + rewrite suggestions. Sibling to break-it-down. Council: psychologist |

## Adding a new skill

1. Create `{skill-name}/SKILL.md` with proper YAML frontmatter (name, description).
2. Add a row to the **Skills inventory** table above in this file — **but only for public skills**. If the skill lives under `_private/` (junction in the root), skip the inventory row and add it to `.gitignore` instead. (README.md links to the inventory — do not duplicate it there.)
3. Keep supporting docs inside the skill folder.
4. Each skill should have a README.md that expands on the instructions in `SKILL.md` with examples, edge cases, and troubleshooting tips. Link to it from `SKILL.md` if needed.
5. Each skill should be self-contained. If it depends on another skill, link to that skill's README for instructions instead of cross-referencing internal steps.
6. If needed, the skill should have an examples.md with annotated code snippets for common use cases and edge cases. Link to it from the README.
7. Folder names are stable — do not rename once published.

## Editing an existing skill

- The `SKILL.md` at the folder root is the entry point. Never move it.
- Supporting files (formats, deep-dive modules, persona contracts) stay in the same folder.
- Update the skill's README if the workflow or reference files change.
- **Loop Method:** If you add related-skills, related-agents, or a Delegation Map, update the frontmatter + add the section to SKILL.md.
- If the skill can now run recurring, add `loop-eligible: true` and `recurrence-hint: [frequency]`.
