  Analyze a Jira ticket by gathering full context from Jira and Confluence,
  following linked tickets, then running a clarity-council to identify gaps
  and ambiguities. Produces an actionable breakdown plan. All actions are
  read-only. Use when user says "break down this feature", "analyze this
  ticket", "feature breakdown", or provides a Jira ticket key for analysis.

# Feature Breakdown

Read-only analysis of a Jira feature ticket. Gathers context, consults the clarity-council, resolves ambiguities with the user, and produces an actionable breakdown.

**All operations are read-only. Never create, update, or transition Jira tickets.**

## Input

A Jira ticket key (e.g. `PROJ-123`). Extract from the user's message using pattern `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-\d+`.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Gather Context

1. Fetch the root ticket via `jira_get_issue` — capture summary, description, acceptance criteria, status, priority, story points, fix version, and sprint.
2. Fetch comments via `jira_get_comments`.
3. Walk **all linked tickets** (issue links from the root ticket's `issuelinks` field):
   - For each link: fetch via `jira_get_issue`, note the link type (blocks / is blocked by / relates to / etc.).
   - If the root ticket belongs to an **epic/feature**: fetch sibling stories via `jira_get_epic_issues`.
4. Check for **Confluence context**:
   - Fetch remote links via `jira_get_remote_links` — read any linked Confluence pages via `confluence_get_page`.
   - Search Confluence via `confluence_search` with CQL: `text ~ "TICKET-KEY"` to find pages that reference this ticket.
5. Compile a **Context Summary** and present it to the user. Include:
   - Root ticket details
   - Linked ticket summaries (with link types)
   - Confluence page titles and key excerpts
   - Any acceptance criteria found

**Gate:** Ask the user if any additional tickets or documents should be included before proceeding.

### Phase 2 — Council Analysis

Invoke `/clarity-council` using `council_consult` mode:

- **user_problem**: "Analyze this feature and identify what is being asked, what assumptions are being made, and what gaps or ambiguities exist."
- **context**: The full Context Summary from Phase 1.
- **desired_outcome**: "A clear understanding of the feature scope, identified gaps, risks, and open questions that need answers before implementation can begin."
- **selected_personas**: Senior Architect, Product Owner, Tech Lead, QA Engineer, Devil's Advocate
- **depth**: standard

Present the council's synthesis to the user: agreements, conflicts, risks/tradeoffs, and the questions each persona raised.

### Phase 3 — Clarify

Collect all unresolved questions from the council output and any gaps identified in Phase 1.

Ask the user **one question at a time**. For each question:
- State which persona raised it and why it matters.
- Offer a recommended answer if the gathered context suggests one.
- Wait for the user's response before asking the next question.

Continue until:
- All questions are resolved, OR
- The user says they have enough clarity to proceed.

### Phase 4 — Breakdown Plan

Using the resolved context, produce a structured breakdown. See [BREAKDOWN-FORMAT.md](BREAKDOWN-FORMAT.md) for the output template.

Each item in the breakdown should include:
- **What**: A concrete, implementable unit of work
- **Why**: How it connects to the feature goal
- **Acceptance criteria**: Testable conditions (derived from the ticket + council analysis)
- **Dependencies**: Which other items must complete first
- **Risk/complexity**: Flag from council analysis (if any)

**Gate:** Present the breakdown and ask:
1. Does this cover the full scope?
2. Are any items too large or too small?
3. Should any items be reordered or merged?

Iterate until the user approves.

## Constraints

- **Read-only**: Never call `jira_create_issue`, `jira_update_issue`, `jira_transition_issue`, or any write operation on Jira or Confluence.
- Do not create files on disk unless the user explicitly asks to save the breakdown.
- If the Jira ticket key cannot be found, stop and ask the user to provide a valid key.
