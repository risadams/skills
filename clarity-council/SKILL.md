# Clarity Council: Agent-Based System

This skill routes to three specialized agents in the `agents/00-council/` folder. Use the appropriate agent based on your decision-making need.

## When to use

Use this system when you need any of the following:
- Quick expert opinion from one persona
- Multiple expert viewpoints with synthesis
- Iterative decision-making with clarifications
- Structured tradeoff analysis

Do not use for pure factual lookup with no decision component.

## Which Agent to Use?

### Single Expert Perspective
**Agent**: `council-single-persona`  
**When**: You need focused advice from one expert (quick, 10–15 min)  
**Example**: "As a senior-architect, should we migrate to microservices?"

### Multiple Expert Synthesis
**Agent**: `council-multi-persona`  
**When**: A decision needs multiple viewpoints synthesized (20–30 min)  
**Example**: "Convene a council on Kubernetes adoption."

### Iterative Decision-Making
**Agent**: `council-iterative`  
**When**: You need multi-turn iteration with clarifications (30–60 min, 3–5 turns)  
**Example**: "Run a council on team restructuring. I'll iterate."

## Agent Invocation

Simply invoke the appropriate agent directly:

```
/council-single-persona
  As a product-owner, should we ship this quarter?

/council-multi-persona
  Convene a council on whether to adopt TypeScript.

/council-iterative
  Run a council on payment processor selection. I'll iterate.
```

See the full documentation at `agents/00-council/README.md` and `agents/00-council/INDEX.md`.

## Output templates

Use these structures exactly unless the user asks for a different format.

### Single persona output

assumptions:
- <assumption>
questions:
- <question>

Before finalizing a response:
- ensure recommendations tie to stated constraints
- separate assumptions from facts
- include at least one concrete next step
- include at least one explicit risk or tradeoff for non-trivial decisions
- keep terminology consistent with persona names in [skills/personas/PERSONAS.md](skills/personas/PERSONAS.md)
