# Daily Briefing

Personal daily briefing. Read-only by default for the report; calendar focus-block drafts require user approval before creation.

## Related skills

- **obsidian-markdown** — canonical reference for Obsidian Flavored Markdown (frontmatter, wikilinks, embeds, callouts, properties). The vault writes in this skill use OFM syntax; consult `obsidian-markdown` if you need to extend the templates with new constructs (callouts, block IDs, mermaid options, etc.) rather than reinventing the syntax inline.
- **obsidian-bases** — reference for `.base` file authoring (filters, formulas, views). Used by step 6 when the embedded dashboards are missing from the vault.
- **clarity-council (personal-assistant persona)** — owns the focus-block proposal in step 9 and the executive-summary "next actions" framing. The persona's Decision Lens (reduce mental load, prevent missed commitments, keep the next action obvious) is the load-bearing voice for the whole briefing — its Output Requirements (next action, timing/deadline, dependencies/follow-ups) shape both the open-action-items section and the focus-block table.

## Quick start

1. Find the most recent prior daily note in the vault to determine the briefing window (covers gaps from weekends, alternating Fridays off, holidays, vacations).
2. Pull inbox + calendar from that window-start through now, plus today's calendar.
3. Discover vault link conventions (person notes, tags) — see step 5.
4. Render the daily report (see [REPORT_TEMPLATE.md](REPORT_TEMPLATE.md)) and **save it to the Obsidian vault**.
5. Update the weekly rollup note (see [WEEKLY_TEMPLATE.md](WEEKLY_TEMPLATE.md)).
6. Update the monthly rollup note (see [MONTHLY_TEMPLATE.md](MONTHLY_TEMPLATE.md)).
7. Propose focus blocks; ask the user before creating any drafts.

## Vault path resolution

The skill needs the **Obsidian vault root** to read prior notes and write new ones. It is referenced throughout this document as `{{vault_root}}` — never hardcode a path.

Resolve `{{vault_root}}` once at the start of every run, in this order:

1. **Loaded memory.** Scan the auto-loaded `MEMORY.md` index and any reference memories already in context for a `**Vault root:**` line (or equivalent key like `vault_root:` / `obsidian_vault:`). The canonical entry is `reference_obsidian_vault.md` — its first content line reads `**Vault root:** <absolute path>`. Use that path verbatim.
2. **Memory file lookup.** If the index references a vault memory (e.g. `[Obsidian vault](reference_obsidian_vault.md)`) but the file isn't already loaded, `Read` it and extract the `**Vault root:**` value.
3. **Prompt the user.** If neither of the above yields a path, ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
   *"I need your Obsidian vault root path to save the daily briefing. What's the absolute path? (e.g. `C:\Users\you\Documents\my-vault\`)"*
   Single-select with one option — `Other` lets the user type the path.
4. **Persist the answer.** After receiving a user-provided path, save it to memory so future runs skip the prompt:
   - If `reference_obsidian_vault.md` exists, `Read` it, update the `**Vault root:**` line, and `Write` it back.
   - If it does not exist, create it with frontmatter (`name: obsidian-vault-root`, `type: reference`, short description) and a `**Vault root:**` body line, then add a one-line entry to `MEMORY.md`: `- [Obsidian vault root](reference_obsidian_vault.md) -- vault base path used by daily-briefing`.
5. **Validate.** Verify `{{vault_root}}` exists with a single `Glob("{{vault_root}}/*")`. If empty or errors, surface the failure and re-prompt — do not write to a non-existent path.

After resolution, every path literal below uses `{{vault_root}}` as the prefix.

**Daily note path:** `{{vault_root}}\📅\YYYY\MM\YYYY-MM-DDD.md` — Pittsburgh local date, with a literal `D` prefix on the **day component only** (e.g., `2026\05\2026-05-D05.md` for May 5, 2026).

**Weekly note path:** `{{vault_root}}\📅\YYYY\MM\YYYY-W{NN}.md` — ISO week-year and week number, month folder follows the week's Monday (e.g., `2026\05\2026-W19.md` for the week of May 4, 2026).

**Monthly note path:** `{{vault_root}}\📅\YYYY\YYYY-M{MM}.md` — calendar year and month. Lives in the **year folder**, not in a month subfolder (e.g., `2026\2026-M05.md` for May 2026).

## Workflow

### 1. Determine briefing window

Find the most recent prior daily note so the window covers everything since the last run — gaps from weekends, alternating Fridays off, holidays, and vacations all collapse to a single catch-up briefing.

1. `Glob("{{vault_root}}/📅/**/[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-D[0-9][0-9].md")` — enumerate all daily notes.
2. Parse the date from each filename (`YYYY-MM-DDD.md` → `YYYY-MM-DD`). Filter to dates **strictly before today** (Pittsburgh local).
3. Pick the maximum (most recent) date — call it `last_run_date`.
4. Compute `window_start`:
   - **Default** — `last_run_date` at 06:00 America/New_York (right before that morning's briefing was generated).
   - **No prior note found**, or the most recent note is older than **14 days** — fall back to 24h before now and tell the user "no recent prior note within 14 days; using 24h fallback window."
   - **Cap at 14 days** even if a prior note exists further back, to avoid blowing context. Warn the user when capping.
5. Compute `gap_days = today - last_run_date`. If `gap_days > 1`, this is a **backfill briefing** — note that in the executive summary and label the email section with the actual date range.

State the chosen window in one short sentence before gathering data, e.g. *"Backfilling since [[2026-05-D07]] (Thu) — 4-day window."*

### 2. Gather data (parallel)

Call these in a single response, using `window_start` from step 1:

- `outlook_get_inbox_emails(since=<window_start ISO>, include_read=true, max_results=50)` — email since last briefing. If `gap_days > 2`, raise `max_results` to 100.
- `outlook_get_calendar_events(start=<window_start>, end=<now>)` — meetings since last briefing.
- `outlook_get_calendar_events(start=<today 00:00>, end=<today 23:59>)` — today's schedule.

If inbox volume is high (>30 emails), also call `outlook_get_unread_emails(max_results=25)` to ensure unread items aren't lost.

`outlook_get_inbox_emails` accepts ISO datetimes for `since` (also `today`, `yesterday`, `7d` shorthands). Prefer the explicit ISO datetime so backfill windows of arbitrary length are exact.

### 3. Triage email

For each email in the briefing window, classify into one bucket:

- **Action required** — direct ask, question, deadline, @mention, or you're the sole recipient
- **FYI** — informational, CC'd with no ask, automated digest
- **Awaiting reply** — emails *you* sent that have no response yet (check Sent Items if needed)

Only fetch full body via `outlook_get_email_by_id` when subject + preview is ambiguous. Keep it cheap.

#### 3a. Action vs. FYI classifier (load-bearing rule)

Default to **FYI**. Promote to **Action required** only when the email passes BOTH a verb test and an addressed-to-user test. Most morning false positives come from over-eager promotion — when in doubt, demote.

**Verb test — does the email ask the user to *do* something?**

The body or subject must contain an actionable verb directed at the user: *reply, review, approve, merge, sign, decide, schedule, draft, fix, investigate, attend, confirm-by-deadline, vote, complete-form, RSVP*. Status verbs (*is, was, has been, will be, completed, deployed, merged, closed*) describe state and do not qualify.

**Addressed-to-user test — is the ask aimed at the user?**

- ✅ User is in `To:` and named in the ask, OR user is the sole recipient, OR user is explicitly @mentioned in body
- ❌ User is on `Cc:` with no name-call ("CC'd for awareness")
- ❌ Email is to a distribution list (`pyrite-team@`, `bessemer-all@`) with no per-user ask
- ❌ Automated notification (Jira `DoNotReply`, GitLab pipeline, Outlook calendar response) with no human ask layered on top

**Auto-demote to FYI (do NOT render as Action required):**

| Pattern | Why it's FYI |
| :--- | :--- |
| **OOO autoresponder / "I'm out of office, contact X"** | The "contact X" is conditional on the user *needing* something; the email itself contains no ask. Render in FYI as `[[@Person]] is OOO {{dates}}; covered by [[@Backup]]`. |
| **Status broadcast** ("X has been deployed", "Sprint 4 starts Monday", "RHOSP maintenance window confirmed") | State report. No verb directed at the user. |
| **Calendar invite, no body content, you're not the organizer** | The invite itself is the action — accepting/declining is handled in Outlook, not via the briefing. |
| **"FYI" / "For your awareness" / "Heads up" subject lines** | The sender already self-classified. Trust them. |
| **Automated digests** (newsletters, build pipeline summaries, Jira sprint-scope-change pings) | No human ask. |
| **Reply-all chatter on a thread where someone else owns the resolution** | The user is a witness, not an actor. Render as FYI ("12 comments on !2109 — Padmaraju iterating; spot-check optional"). |
| **"Thanks!" / "Got it" / acknowledgment-only replies** | No ask. |
| **Meeting recap / minutes with no per-attendee action items** | The action items live inside; if the user has one named in the body, *that* is the Action — not the recap email itself. |

**When promoting to Action required, the bullet must answer: *what verb, by when, blocking what?*** If you can't answer all three, demote to FYI.

**Record what was demoted.** Track every email that *could* have been promoted but was demoted by this rule (subject + sender + one-word reason). After triage, append a single footer line under the FYI section: `> _Auto-demoted from Action (N items): {{subject}} ({{reason}}); {{subject}} ({{reason}})._` so the user can audit the classifier without re-reading every email.

### 4. Analyze today's schedule

Identify:

- **Conflicts** — overlapping meetings
- **Back-to-back stretches** — 3+ consecutive meetings with no gap
- **Prep gaps** — high-stakes meetings (external attendees, leadership, customer) with no buffer beforehand
- **Free blocks** — contiguous gaps ≥45 min suitable for focus work
- **No-lunch flag** — no free block between 11:30–13:30

### 5. Discover vault link conventions

Before rendering, scan the vault to find existing notes for people mentioned in the briefing data (meeting attendees, email senders). This lets the report use real `[[wikilinks]]` instead of plain names.

**People convention:** each person has their own folder under `🤼 Team/{Category}/{Display Name}/` (e.g., `Dev Teams/Alex R/`, `Dev Teams/Sam/`), and the canonical note inside is `@Firstname Lastname.md` (with literal `@` prefix). Wikilink target uses that filename without extension: `[[@Firstname Lastname]]`.

- `Glob("{{vault_root}}/🤼 Team/**/@*.md")` — enumerate all canonical person notes
- Build a name → wikilink-target map. Match flexibly: full name from email/calendar may need to map to the existing `@First Last` note
- If no match, render the name as plain text — **never invent a wikilink target** (broken links pollute the graph)
- For team/project names (e.g., "Quartz", "Garnet", "Slate" under `Scrum Teams/`), link similarly when a folder/note exists. Verify with `Glob` before linking.

**Team daily notes convention:** each scrum team has its own daily note per work date under `Scrum Teams/{Team}/Scrum 📅/{INC}/{Sprint}/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. The filename is plain ISO date (no `D` prefix — that distinguishes it from your personal daily note `YYYY-MM-DDD.md`). The three parent folders carry the team, increment, and sprint metadata.

- `Glob("{{vault_root}}/Scrum Teams/**/YYYY-MM-DD.md")` — for each date in scope (today for the daily report; each Mon–Fri for the weekly; each week's dates for the monthly), enumerate matching team notes.
- Parse the path: split on `/`, find the segment after `Scrum Teams/` (= **team**), then the segments under `Scrum 📅/` (= **INC**, then **sprint**).
- Wikilink format — use the **full path** with a display alias so Obsidian resolves unambiguously and the link text stays short: `[[Scrum Teams/{Team}/Scrum 📅/{INC}/{Sprint}/YYYY-MM-DD|{Team}]]`. Append the INC/sprint inline as plain text after the link.
- If no team notes exist for a given date, omit the team-notes line entirely (don't render an empty header — the absence is the signal).

### 6. Render the report and save to vault

Use [REPORT_TEMPLATE.md](REPORT_TEMPLATE.md). Lead with the executive summary (3-5 bullets), then the structured sections. Keep the whole report scannable in <60 seconds.

**Executive summary voice — personal-assistant lens.** The summary bullets are not free-form prose; they are written through the **personal-assistant** persona's Decision Lens (reduce mental load, prevent missed commitments, keep the next action obvious). Each bullet must satisfy the persona's Output Requirements: the **next action**, the **timing/deadline** if known, and any **dependency or follow-up**. Avoid bullets that merely describe the day ("4 meetings, 12 unread emails") in favor of bullets that name what the user should do about them ("Reply to [[@Alex R]]'s spec question before the 2pm review — blocks [[@Sam Chen]]'s implementation"). When 3+ bullets compete for the top slot, apply the persona's Eisenhower framing (urgent × important) to rank.

**Carryover rule (Open Action Items):** when populating the `Carrying over (still open)` subsection from the prior daily note (`last_run_date`), `Read` that note's `### ✅ Open Action Items` section and copy **only `- [ ]` lines**. Every `- [x]` line is already done — drop it. This rule applies to both subsections of the prior note (`Carrying over` and `New / from window`); merge the surviving `- [ ]` items into today's `Carrying over (still open)`. If the prior note has zero remaining `- [ ]` items, omit the subsection entirely rather than render an empty header.

**Mandatory: every surviving `- [ ]` item from `last_run_date` MUST be run through the phantom-carryover guard (below) BEFORE being rendered in today's note.** The carryover rule produces a *candidate list*; the phantom guard is the *filter* that decides which candidates survive. Skipping the phantom guard is the #1 cause of stale items re-spawning across weeks (see [[feedback_basile_sc2_23240_resolved]] for a 9-note phantom). Do not render any `- [ ]` carryover bullet that has not been age-scored and signal-checked.

**Recently-closed dedup rule (applies to `New / from window`):** before adding a `- [ ]` bullet to today's `New / from window` subsection, check whether the same actionable item was completed in any of the last **7 daily notes**. This catches the case where the underlying state (an unanswered email, an open Outlook flag, a stale Jira watcher) still looks "open" to Outlook but the user actually closed the loop offline and marked the vault `[x]` — without this check the briefing keeps re-spawning the same item with louder emojis (see [[feedback_briefing_stale_action_dedup]]).

1. `Glob("{{vault_root}}/📅/**/[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-D[0-9][0-9].md")`, filter to the **7 most recent dates strictly before today**.
2. For each, `Read` the file and collect every `- [x]` line under `### ✅ Open Action Items` (both subsections).
3. **Match heuristic** — two items are "the same" if their normalized action signatures match. Signature = lowercase + strip emojis/badges (⚠/🚨/🟥/🟧 etc.) + strip overdue/deadline annotations (`OVERDUE`, `N DAYS OVERDUE`, `due Fri YYYY-MM-DD`, `(was due ...)`) + strip the leading verb-and-target keyword pair only (e.g., `reply to @Jon Szymczak` + `April shout-outs` survive; the noise around them does not). Wikilinks like `[[@Jon Szymczak]]` count as their inner name. Tag suffixes (`#email`, `#mr`) are part of the signature only when they materially change the action.
4. **Apply by recency**:
   - **Match in last 3 days (days T−1, T−2, T−3)** — **suppress silently**. Do not render the new bullet. Add one consolidated line under the `New / from window` subsection footer: `> _Recently closed (suppressed today): {{normalized title}} (closed [[YYYY-MM-DDD]])._` so the user can see what was filtered.
   - **Match 4–7 days back** — render the new bullet, but prefix with `⚠️ Re-surfaced — last closed [[YYYY-MM-DDD]]. Confirm: still open, re-opened, or false re-spawn?` and raise an `AskUserQuestion` before writing the file. Options: `Still open (keep)`, `Already done (suppress like recent)`, `Re-opened — clarify` (free text). Apply the answer to today's file.
   - **No match in 7 days** — render normally; this is a genuinely new item.
5. This dedup runs only for `New / from window`. The `Carrying over` subsection already filters by `[ ]` vs `[x]` and does not need the recency check.

**Suppression memory check (applies to BOTH `Carrying over` and `New / from window`):** at the start of action-item rendering, scan loaded memory for any `feedback_*_resolved.md` entries (the convention is documented in the Phantom-carryover guard below). Each such memory documents a specific item that should **never** be rendered as an action again. For every `- [ ]` candidate, compare its normalized signature against the suppression memory's signature. On match, drop the candidate silently and add a one-line footer under `New / from window`: `> _Suppressed by [[<memory-name>]] ({{reason}})._` Do not prompt — the user has already decided.

**Action-item classifier (applies to BOTH `Carrying over` and `New / from window`):** before rendering ANY `- [ ]` bullet in this section, re-apply the verb test and addressed-to-user test from § 3a. The Open Action Items section is for things the user must *do* — not for state they should *know*. If the bullet is informational (status broadcast, OOO acknowledgment, FYI), move it to the Notes & Follow-ups section as a plain bullet (no checkbox).

Concrete patterns to catch (these have all leaked through before):

- **"Reach out to [[@Person]] backups — OOO through M/DD"** — the user only reaches out *if* they need that person. Pure FYI. Render in Notes & Follow-ups as `[[@Person]] OOO through {{date}}; backups: [[@Backup1]], [[@Backup2]]`.
- **"Read [meeting notes / newsletter / addendum]"** — only an action if a specific decision is pending or a question is directed at the user. Otherwise FYI.
- **"Verify X was sent yesterday"** — borderline. Keep as Action only if the verification is time-critical (e.g., RHOSP shutdown ack with maintenance starting today). Otherwise demote.
- **"Decide: [topic]"** with no external deadline and no one waiting on the answer — this is a personal-grooming item, not a commitment. Move to a separate `### 💭 Open questions (no external deadline)` subsection inside Notes & Follow-ups; do NOT carry as `- [ ]`.

**Phantom-carryover guard (REQUIRED for every `- [ ]` carryover candidate):** an item that has carried as `- [ ]` for more than **5 consecutive daily notes** with no fresh email/Jira/MR/calendar signal in the briefing window is almost certainly stale — and even items at age 3-4 with no fresh signal warrant a prompt. The guard has three explicit phases; **never skip them, even when running non-interactively**. Apply this check BEFORE the age-3 prompt below.

**Phase A — Compute age (explicit scan, not inference).**

The carryover rule reads only `last_run_date`. The age scan reads further back. This is the load-bearing distinction — without the explicit scan, items have "age 1" forever from the briefing's perspective even though they've been carrying for weeks.

1. `Glob("{{vault_root}}/📅/**/[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-D[0-9][0-9].md")`, filter to the **14 most recent dates strictly before today**, sorted descending.
2. For each candidate item from `last_run_date`, normalize its signature (per the dedup rule's normalizer in § 6 step 3 — lowercase, strip emojis/badges/deadline-annotations, keep verb+target keyword pair).
3. `Read` each of the 14 prior notes' `### ✅ Open Action Items` sections. Count consecutive prior notes (walking backward from `last_run_date`) where the same normalized signature appears as `- [ ]`. Stop counting at the first gap (a note where the signature is absent or `- [x]`).
4. `age = that consecutive count`. If the item appears as `- [ ]` in `last_run_date` only and nowhere prior in the 14-day window, `age = 1`.

**Phase B — Check for fresh signal (explicit checklist, not vibes).**

A "fresh signal" means *new evidence in the current briefing window that the item is genuinely live*. The check is a fixed checklist — do not infer freshness from tangential mentions.

For each item with `age ≥ 3`, scan the current briefing window's data (the emails + calendar from step 2) and mark a fresh signal present **only if at least one of these is true**:

- **Email — direct correspondence.** An email *from* the named person *to* the user (`To:` line, not `Cc:`), OR an email *from* the user *to* the named person, in the briefing window. Mentions of the person in third-party emails (e.g., Viz High Fives, intern intro thread, recap minutes) do **not** count.
- **Email — explicit subject match.** An email subject in the window contains the Jira ticket key, MR number, or document name from the item's signature. PR labels (`gatekeeper_ready` etc.) on a *different* MR do not count.
- **Calendar — scheduled touchpoint.** A meeting in the briefing window or today's calendar lists the named person as an attendee AND is in a context plausibly related to the item (1:1, project sync, review). Standing all-hands meetings (CCB, knowledge transfer, morning coffee) do **not** count.
- **Jira/MR — direct activity.** A `[JIRA]` or `gitlab` notification email in the window references the exact ticket key or MR number in the item's signature. Activity on adjacent tickets does **not** count.

If none of the above are true, **fresh signal is absent**. Do not stretch — the failure mode is over-eager freshness inference (e.g., "Basile is in the Viz High Fives email therefore the Basile SC2-23240 question is still live"). Tangential presence is not freshness.

**Phase C — Decide.**

| `age` | Fresh signal? | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1–2 | (don't check) | Render normally; no prompt. |
| 3–4 | Yes | Continue to the age-3 stale-carryover prompt below. |
| 3–4 | No | Render with `_(phantom check: age N, no fresh signal in window)_` annotation **and** raise the phantom prompt (below). |
| ≥ 5 | Yes | Continue to the age-3 stale-carryover prompt. |
| ≥ 5 | No | Raise the phantom prompt unconditionally. **Do not render the item** until the user responds. |

**Phantom prompt (raised by Phase C):** *"`{{title}}` has been carried as `- [ ]` for {{age}} consecutive daily notes and there's no fresh email/Jira/MR/calendar signal for it in the current briefing window. Most likely this is a phantom — already done, cancelled, or never actionable. Close it?"* Options: `Close as done (mark [x] in all prior carrying notes + suppress today + add to feedback memory)`, `Close as cancelled (same + add one-line reason)`, `Keep — I'm actively working it offline (render today, suppress phantom check for 3 days)`, `Defer to date (free text — suppress until then)`.

**Non-interactive fallback:** if `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable, default to `Close as cancelled` for `age ≥ 5 + no fresh signal` (the strongest phantom signal), and to `Keep` for `age 3-4 + no fresh signal` (weaker signal — favor false-positive carryover over silent suppression). Always surface the auto-decision in the executive summary so the user can reverse it.

**Memory write on close.** When the user picks `Close as done` or `Close as cancelled`, write a `feedback` memory in the format of `feedback_basile_sc2_23240_resolved.md` so the next briefing has a hard suppression backstop even if the original Outlook signal that spawned the item re-fires. Memory name pattern: `feedback_<kebab-case-normalized-signature>_resolved.md`.

**Stale carryover rule (applies to `Carrying over (still open)`):** for each `- [ ]` item being carried over that **survived the phantom-carryover guard** (i.e., was not closed in Phase C), apply the age band logic below. Re-use the `age` value computed in Phase A — do not re-scan.

1. **Age 1–2** — render normally; let the existing overdue/badge logic apply.
2. **Age ≥ 3** — **prompt before rendering**. Raise an `AskUserQuestion` per stale item (batch into one multi-select question if 3+ items qualify): *"`{{normalized title}}` has been carried for {{age}} days. What now?"* Options: `Still doing it (keep)`, `Done — forgot to check (mark [x] in prior note + suppress today)`, `Cancel (mark [x] in prior note + suppress today + add a one-line note explaining why)`, `Defer to date (free text — render as deferred with new deadline, suppress until then)`.
3. **Apply the answer immediately**:
   - *Still doing it* — render today with no extra noise; **cap the visual escalation**: never render more than two warning emojis (e.g., `⚠️⚠️ OVERDUE (N+ days)`) regardless of age. The emoji-wall escalation pattern (`⚠⚠⚠⚠ ... 🚨🚨🚨`) is explicitly forbidden — it stops being signal and starts being noise after day 3.
   - *Done* — `Edit` **every** prior daily note within the 14-day age scan window where the item carried as `- [ ]`, flipping each occurrence to `- [x]`. The phantom guard's 7-day dedup scan reads multiple prior notes, so flipping only the most recent leaves the item visible in older notes and lets it re-spawn from there. Suppress in today's carryover. Print the count of files edited.
   - *Cancel* — same as Done but additionally append ` _(cancelled: {{reason}})_` to the now-checked line in the **most recent** prior note only (one annotation is enough — the others are silent flips).
   - *Defer* — replace the carry-over with a single `- [ ] {{title}} — **deferred to YYYY-MM-DD**` and suppress until that date arrives.
4. If `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable (e.g., non-interactive run), fall back to rendering with the two-emoji cap and surface a warning in the executive summary: *"{{N}} stale carry-over items skipped age-3 prompt — re-run interactively to triage."*

**Embedded visual surfaces** — the template includes `![[Daily Notes Dashboard.base#...]]` and `![[TODO#By tag]]` embeds that auto-render when the file opens. They depend on these vault files existing:
- `📅/Daily Notes Dashboard.base` (views: `All daily notes`, `This Week`, `Recent (cards)`) — scopes to daily notes (`📅/**/YYYY-MM-DDD.md`)
- `📅/Weekly Rollups.base` (views: `All weeks`, `Recent weeks`) — scopes to weekly notes (`📅/**/YYYY-W{NN}.md`)
- `📅/Scrum Team Activity.base` (views: `Recent activity`, `By team`) — scopes to scrum team daily notes under `Scrum Teams/`
- `TODO.md` (sections: `By tag`) — Dataview-driven; out of scope for auto-creation here

**Detect missing bases on every run.** Before saving the daily report:

1. `Glob` for each of the three `.base` files at `📅/`. Build a list of which are missing.
2. If any are missing, prompt the user via `AskUserQuestion`: *"The following dashboard bases are missing from the vault: {{list}}. Create them now? They power the embedded views in the daily/weekly/monthly reports."* Options: `Create all (recommended)`, `Skip — leave broken-link placeholders`, `Choose individually`.
3. For each base the user approves, invoke the `obsidian-bases` skill via `Skill` with the target path, scope (which notes the base filters), and the named views above. `obsidian-bases` is the canonical reference for `.base` YAML grammar — defer schema decisions to it rather than authoring inline. Cross-check the generated YAML against `obsidian-bases`'s troubleshooting section (Duration math, formula quoting) before writing.
4. If the user declines, leave the embed in place — creating the missing file later will fix the rendering automatically.

This check is cheap (3 `Glob` calls) and after the first-run accept, becomes a no-op on subsequent days. `TODO.md` is Dataview-managed by the user and is *not* auto-created here — surface its absence as a warning only.

**⛔ Pre-save section checklist (run BEFORE writing the file).** The chart and team-link sections have silently vanished from real runs before (4 consecutive June 2026 notes lost the Mermaid chart; see [[feedback_daily_note_mandatory_sections]]). Before calling `Write`, confirm the assembled report body contains ALL of these — if any is missing, add it (render a minimal/placeholder version rather than skipping):

1. `#### Day at a glance` with a ` ```mermaid ` `gantt` block.
2. `#### Email triage at a glance` with a ` ```mermaid ` `pie` block.
3. `### 👥 Team Daily Notes` with a `[[Scrum Teams/.../YYYY-MM-DD|...]]` wikilink — **unless** the step-5 `Glob` returned zero team notes for the date (genuine absence).
4. `### 📊 Cross-day context` with both `![[Daily Notes Dashboard.base#Recent (cards)]]` and `![[TODO#By tag]]` embeds.

A plain-bullet schedule table does NOT satisfy #1 — the gantt is required in addition to (not instead of) any table.

**Save to vault:**

1. Compute Pittsburgh date: `YYYY`, `MM`, `YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. Create folders if missing — single command: `mkdir -p "{{vault_root}}/📅/YYYY/MM"` (forward slashes work in bash on Windows; the 📅 emoji is preserved).
3. Target file: `{{vault_root}}/📅/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DDD.md` — the `D` prefix goes on the **day component only**, not the year/month and not the folder names. Example for May 5, 2026: `2026/05/2026-05-D05.md`.
4. **Do not overwrite an existing file silently.** If it exists, `Read` it first and ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` whether to overwrite, append a new section (e.g., `## Afternoon update — HH:MM`), or skip the save.
5. Use `Write` with the full report content (frontmatter + body per template).
6. Print the saved path back to the user as a clickable markdown link.

After saving, also display the executive summary inline in chat so the user gets the briefing without opening the file.

### 7. Update the weekly rollup note

After the daily note is saved, regenerate the weekly rollup. Full template, ISO-week math, and preservation rules in [WEEKLY_TEMPLATE.md](WEEKLY_TEMPLATE.md).

**Workflow:**

1. Compute ISO week-year, ISO week number, and the Monday→Friday dates for this week (Pittsburgh time).
2. Compute the weekly file path: `📅/YYYY/MM/YYYY-W{NN}.md` where `MM` = month of the Monday.
3. Ensure the month folder exists (`mkdir -p`).
4. For each Mon–Fri date, check if `📅/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-D{DD}.md` exists; if so, `Read` it and extract every `- [ ]` line (unchecked only). Also `Glob("Scrum Teams/**/YYYY-MM-DD.md")` for the same date to collect team daily notes (parse team/INC/sprint from the path per step 5).
5. If a weekly file already exists at the target path, `Read` it and capture everything after the `<!-- end:auto-managed -->` marker — that user content must be preserved in the new write. If markers are missing, ask via `AskUserQuestion` before overwriting.
6. Render the new weekly content per [WEEKLY_TEMPLATE.md](WEEKLY_TEMPLATE.md): navigation links, week-at-a-glance (2-4 bullets pulled from today's executive summary + cross-day themes), and the per-day TODO rollup.
7. `Write` the file: auto-managed region + preserved user content (or default `## Notes` placeholder if none).
8. Print the saved weekly path back to the user as a clickable markdown link.

**Bidirectional links:** the daily note's frontmatter or footer should link to the weekly note (`[[YYYY-W{NN}]]`), and each daily entry in the weekly rollup links to the daily note. This makes Obsidian's graph and backlinks work both ways.

### 8. Update the monthly rollup note

After the weekly note is saved, regenerate the monthly rollup. Full template, week-selection logic, and preservation rules in [MONTHLY_TEMPLATE.md](MONTHLY_TEMPLATE.md).

**Workflow:**

1. Compute the current calendar year and month (Pittsburgh time).
2. Compute the monthly file path: `📅/YYYY/YYYY-M{MM}.md` — this lives in the **year folder**, not a month subfolder.
3. Ensure the year folder exists (`mkdir -p`).
4. Determine which weeks to include: all ISO weeks whose **Monday** falls in the current month, plus one trailing week for forward visibility (typically 5 entries; 6 if the month has 5 in-month Mondays).
5. For each selected week, check if `📅/YYYY/MM/YYYY-W{NN}.md` exists (where `MM` follows that week's Monday). If so, `Read` it and extract the bullets under the `#### 🎯 Week at a glance` section. Also `Glob("Scrum Teams/**/YYYY-MM-DD.md")` for each Mon–Fri of the week and aggregate the distinct **{team} {INC} / {sprint}** combinations that appeared at least once during the week.
6. If a monthly file already exists at the target path, `Read` it and capture everything after the `<!-- end:auto-managed -->` marker. If markers are missing (legacy format), prompt via `AskUserQuestion` before overwriting.
7. Render the new monthly content per [MONTHLY_TEMPLATE.md](MONTHLY_TEMPLATE.md): navigation with `<button class="date_button_today">This Month</button>`, month-at-a-glance (2-4 synthesized themes), and the per-week rollup with date ranges.
8. `Write` the file: auto-managed region + preserved user content.
9. Print the saved monthly path back to the user as a clickable markdown link.

**Note on cascading updates:** the monthly rollup reads from weekly notes, which read from daily notes. Always update in order — daily → weekly → monthly — so each layer reflects the latest data.

### 9. Propose focus blocks

**Delegate to `council-single-persona` agent (personal-assistant persona).** This step doesn't author the block list inline — invoke the agent via `Skill`:

**Invocation**:
```
Agent: council-single-persona

As a personal-assistant, propose focus blocks for today that pull the highest-leverage 
open actions into the free time available.

Open actions:
[carry-over items from prior days]
[new action items from today]

Today's prep needs:
[high-stakes meetings without buffer time]

Free blocks (≥45 min):
[list of available time slots]

Constraints:
[no-lunch flag if set, other scheduling rules]

Output:
- Prioritized focus blocks with start/end times
- For each block: which action item(s) it covers, why this priority order
- Confidence level for each recommendation
```
- **desired_outcome:** *"A ranked focus-block proposal table — `Time | Block | Purpose` — where each row obeys the persona's Output Requirements: names a concrete next action, ties to a deadline or commitment, and surfaces any dependency (e.g. blocked-by-person, awaiting-input). Apply the Eisenhower Matrix to rank urgent × important. Protect attention: do not propose more than 3 blocks before lunch, and do not break a long contiguous free block into fragments unless the underlying actions genuinely call for it."*
- **constraints:** `[only propose blocks that fit into existing free time (no overlapping meetings), preserve at least one 45-minute uninterrupted window if the day allows it, do not auto-fill every gap]`
- **depth:** `brief`

The persona's Failure Modes (overcommitting, fragmenting attention, turning a small ask into a process) and Blind Spots (over-organizing at the expense of judgment) are the guardrails — if the council output trips them, re-prompt before showing the user.

Present the returned proposal table to the user, then ask via `AskUserQuestion` which blocks (if any) to add to the calendar. For each approved block, call `outlook_check_calendar_conflict` first, then `outlook_create_meeting_draft` with no attendees and `busy_status="busy"`. Never create blocks without explicit approval.

## Rules

- **Read-only for Outlook.** Never mark emails read, flag, move, or delete during briefing.
- **Vault writes are scoped.** Only write to `{{vault_root}}\📅\` — never modify other vault folders.
- **Never overwrite an existing daily note silently.** Always confirm with the user first.
- **Weekly and monthly notes: auto-managed region only.** Regenerate the content between the `<!-- begin:auto-managed by daily-briefing skill -->` and `<!-- end:auto-managed -->` markers. Preserve everything outside those markers verbatim. If markers are missing on an existing weekly or monthly note (legacy hand-edited format), prompt before overwriting — there may be user-authored content to migrate.
- **Checkboxes for action items.** All open action items use `- [ ]` so the global `TODO.md` Dataview query (which scans `📅/`) picks them up automatically.
- **Wikilinks only when targets exist.** Verify the note exists before writing `[[Name]]` — broken links pollute the graph.
- **Drafts only for calendar blocks.** Use `outlook_create_meeting_draft` (opens for review); never auto-send or auto-create finalized appointments.
- **Confirm before drafting.** Always ask which proposed blocks to create — don't batch all.
- **Respect privacy.** If an email subject contains "confidential", "personal", "HR", or "legal", surface only "private email from <sender>" without subject details.
- **Time math.** All times reported in **local time** (America/New_York — EST/EDT, observes DST). Outlook returns local; if any value comes back in UTC or another zone, convert before display. When computing "24 hours ago", anchor on current Pittsburgh wall-clock time.
- **Unavailable MCP.** If `mcp__outlook__*` tools fail, tell the user the Outlook MCP isn't responsive and stop — don't fabricate a briefing.

## Edge cases

- **No emails / empty calendar:** still render the report with "Nothing to triage" / "Open day" — useful signal.
- **All-day events:** treat as context, not as schedule blockers (unless `busy_status="out_of_office"`).
- **Recurring meeting series:** count as one item in the briefing, not N.
- **Cancelled meetings:** call out separately so the user knows freed-up time.
- **No prior daily note found:** first run ever, or `📅/` is empty — fall back to the standard 24h window and tell the user.
- **Last note > 14 days ago:** long vacation / extended absence — cap the window at 14 days, generate the briefing, and warn the user that older items aren't included. Suggest searching email manually for anything time-sensitive from the gap period.
- **Today's note already exists (re-run same day):** treat the *prior* day's note as `last_run_date` (not today's) so the window doesn't collapse to zero. The "overwrite/append/skip" prompt for today's note still applies at save time.
- **Backfill briefing:** the daily note still saves to today's path only — one consolidated catch-up note, not one note per missing day. The window label and executive-summary callout make the multi-day scope explicit.
