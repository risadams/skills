# Ink and Agency Skill Pack

An opinionated library of reusable prompt skills for Claude and compatible agents.

The pack is built to work well with Claude-compatible skill loading, but most of the content is deliberately plain Markdown and easy to adapt to other prompt-driven agents. Each folder is a self-contained skill, so you can browse the pack like a catalog instead of reading a giant manual.

**Part of the Ink and Agency ecosystem:** These skills work alongside the **[Ink and Agency Agents Collection](../agents/README.md)** for focused capabilities and deep domain expertise.

## What’s in the pack

- Practical skills for writing, planning, triage, architecture, and workspace workflows
- One `SKILL.md` entry point per skill folder
- Supporting docs where a skill needs examples, formats, or deeper guidance
- A structure that works directly with Claude and can usually be adapted to other agents with light changes

## Skill Map

| Area | Example skills | What they help with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Writing & messaging | `writing-humanize`, `writing-tone-check`, `writing-apology-calibrator`, `writing-social-script` | Composing long-form text, calibrating outgoing messages, scripting awkward conversations |
| Analysis | `break-it-down`, `codebase-explain`, `issue-triage` | Making sense of a codebase, decoding incoming messages, diagnosing bugs faster |
| Collaboration | `clarity-council`, `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs` | Getting sharper decisions through structured discussion |
| Planning | `sprint-plan`, `sprint-review`, `daily-briefing`, `handoff` | Organizing work, progress, reporting, and context continuity |
| Focus & state | `task-initiation`, `hyperfocus-recovery`, `idea-decision-maker`, `energy-budget`, `meeting-decompression` | Defeating stalls, recovering context, calibrating load — built with ND-friendly defaults |
| Git & workflow | `branch-rebase`, `branch-resolve-conflicts` | Clean rebases with trivial conflict auto-resolution, complex conflict resolution with intent preservation |
| Workspace tools | `obsidian-vault`, `obsidian-markdown`, `obsidian-canvas` | Managing notes, structure, and visual knowledge maps |

## Quick Start

For Claude, clone this repository into your skills directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:risadams/skills.git "$HOME/.claude/skills"
```

That’s it. Once the repo is in place, Claude can discover the skills directly from the folder structure.

If you are using another agent, the same folder layout is still useful, but the install location and invocation rules may differ.

## Check the install

After cloning, you should see paths like these:

- `$HOME/.claude/skills/writing-humanize/SKILL.md`
- `$HOME/.claude/skills/clarity-council/SKILL.md`
- `$HOME/.claude/skills/codebase-explain/SKILL.md`

## Using skills

There is no separate run command.

In Claude, skills are triggered in chat by asking for the behavior you want. A few examples:

- Use `writing-humanize` on this paragraph.
- Use `codebase-explain` for this module.
- Triage `PROJ-1234`.
- Run a `clarity-council` on this design.

In other agents, the same prompts often still work, but you may need to wire the skill files into that agent's own prompt, skill, or tool-loading system.

## Skills + Agents: Working Together

This skill pack is part of the **[Ink and Agency ecosystem](https://risadams.com/blog/2026/05/18/introducing-ink-and-agency-an-ai-skill-pack-for-humans-and-claude)** and integrates with the companion **[Agents Collection](https://github.com/risadams/claude-subagent)**.

### What's the Difference?

| | Skill | Agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Focused capability | Deep domain specialist |
| **Lifetime** | One-off or repetitive | Long-running, persistent |
| **Examples** | code-review, writing-humanize | backend-developer, security-auditor |
| **Use when** | You need a quick, structured technique | You need complete ownership of a domain |

### Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Skill + Agent Enhancement**  
A skill augments an agent's output during workflow:

```text
Backend developer agent 
  → implements API 
  → code-review skill → validated schema
```

**Pattern 2: Skill → Agent Escalation**  
A skill recognizes deeper work is needed and recommends an agent:

```text
Writing-humanize skill 
  → AI patterns removed 
  → suggests content-quality-editor agent
```

**Pattern 3: Composition**  
Complex workflows chain multiple skills and agents:

```text
Planning + Skills + Agents
  → sprint-plan skill 
  → project-manager agent 
  → backlog-grooming skill
```

### Finding Related Agents

Each skill can declare related agents in its frontmatter. Look for the `related-agents` field:

```yaml
related-agents:
  - code-reviewer
  - security-auditor
```

For complete integration details, see **[INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md)**.

## Compatibility

This pack is Claude-compatible first, but it is not Claude-only.

Most skills in this repo are prompt assets with a stable folder structure, so they usually port cleanly to other agents. In practice, you may need to adjust:

- Install location, because other agents may not read from `.claude/skills`
- Frontmatter fields, if another agent expects different metadata keys
- Tool names or allowed-tool lists, if the target agent exposes a different tool model
- Invocation patterns, if the target agent uses commands, slash prompts, or manifests instead of folder discovery

If an agent can read Markdown prompt files and route on instructions, the content itself usually needs little or no rewriting. The main work is usually integration, not rewriting the skill.

## Browse the catalog

The full inventory lives in **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#skills-inventory)**. That file is the source of truth for the skill list and descriptions, which keeps this README short and prevents drift.
